Problem Description :- Environmental pollution, particularly air pollution, has emerged as a critical global issue, with severe health implications and a significant impact on the quality of life. In the context of India, where air pollution is reported to be deadlier than in China, it is imperative to analyze and understand the trends in air quality across different states over the years. The goal of this project is to create a Tableau Dashboard using the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India. The primary objective is to explore the relationship between air quality changes and shifts in environmental policies in India.

The steps included while working on this project are :-
1) Data Source
2) Data Exploration
3) Dashboard design
4) Air quality and policy analysis
5) User interactions
6) Insights and recommendations
7) Documentations
